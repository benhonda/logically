What is the minimum rules you need for propositional logic deduction proofs?

In propositional logic, a deduction proof is a sequence of statements (called "premises") that lead to a final statement (called the "conclusion"), with each statement being derived from the preceding statements using certain logical rules. The minimum set of rules that you need for propositional logic deduction proofs include:

    Modus Ponens: If P is true and "P implies Q" is true, then Q must be true. This is often written as "P, P→Q / Q".

    Modus Tollens: If "P implies Q" is true and Q is false, then P must be false. This is often written as "P→Q, ~Q / ~P".

    Hypothetical Syllogism: If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R. This is often written as "P→Q, Q→R / P→R".

    Disjunctive Syllogism: If P or Q is true, and P is false, then Q must be true. This is often written as "P∨Q, ~P / Q".

    Conjunction: If P and Q are both true, then "P and Q" is true. This is often written as "P, Q / P∧Q".

    Addition: If P is true, then "P or Q" is true. This is often written as "P / P∨Q".

These rules form the basic set of rules for propositional logic deduction proofs. You can also use additional rules, such as double negation, De Morgan's laws, and others, to help derive conclusions from the given premises.
What are the minimum rules you need for propositional logic deduction proofs when the only connectives are negation, conjunction, and disjunction?

If the only connectives that are allowed in a propositional logic deduction proof are negation (not), conjunction (and), and disjunction (or), then the minimum set of rules that you need for the proof would include:

    Conjunction: If P and Q are both true, then "P and Q" is true. This is often written as "P, Q / P∧Q".

    Disjunction: If P is true or Q is true, then "P or Q" is true. This is often written as "P / P∨Q" or "Q / P∨Q".

    Negation: If P is true, then "not P" is false. If P is false, then "not P" is true. This is often written as "P / ~P" or "~P / P".

    Modus Ponens: If P is true and "P implies Q" is true, then Q must be true. This is often written as "P, P→Q / Q".

    Modus Tollens: If "P implies Q" is true and Q is false, then P must be false. This is often written as "P→Q, ~Q / ~P".

    Hypothetical Syllogism: If P implies Q and Q implies R, then P implies R. This is often written as "P→Q, Q→R / P→R".

    Disjunctive Syllogism: If P or Q is true, and P is false, then Q must be true. This is often written as "P∨Q, ~P / Q".

These rules form the basic set of rules for propositional logic deduction proofs when the only connectives are negation, conjunction, and disjunction. Note that the rules of conjunction and disjunction are both rules of introduction, which means that they can be used to introduce a new connective into a proof. The other rules (Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, and Disjunctive Syllogism) are all rules of elimination, which means that they can be used to eliminate a connective from a proof.
Write a Python script that accepts one parameter, the number of unique propositional variables, and outputs a random valid natural deduction proof using only the negation, conjunctive, and disjunctive connections

Here is a Python script that generates a random valid natural deduction proof using only the negation, conjunction, and disjunction connectives:

import random

def generate_proof(num_vars):
  # Create a list of propositional variables
  variables = ['P' + str(i) for i in range(1, num_vars+1)]
  
  # Choose a random conclusion for the proof
  conclusion = random.choice(variables)
  
  # Initialize the proof with the conclusion as the first line
  proof = [conclusion]
  
  # Keep generating premises until the proof is complete
  while len(proof) > 0:
    # Choose a random premise to add to the proof
    premise = random.choice(variables)
    
    # Choose a random connective to connect the premise to the conclusion
    connective = random.choice(['~', '∧', '∨'])
    
    # Add the premise and connective to the proof
    proof = [premise + ' ' + connective] + proof
    
    # If the connective is negation, we have reached the end of the proof
    if connective == '~':
      break
  
  # Return the completed proof as a string
  return ' / '.join(proof)

# Test the function with num_vars = 3
print(generate_proof(3))

This script generates a random conclusion, and then generates random premises and connectives to form a valid natural deduction proof using only negation, conjunction, and disjunction. The proof is returned as a string, with each premise and connective separated by a space and each line of the proof separated by a slash.

For example, the output of the script might be something like "P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3 / P1 ∧ P2 ∨ P3 / P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3 / P3". This represents a proof with four lines, with the conclusion being "P3" and the premises being "P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3", "P1 ∧ P2 ∨ P3", and "P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3".
Write a Python script that accepts one parameter, the number of unique propositional variables, and outputs a natural deduction proof problem that is random, valid, uses only the negation, conjunctive, and disjunctive connections, and only outputs the conclusion and the minimum number of premises required to prove it.

Here is a Python script that generates a random natural deduction proof problem with a minimum number of premises using only the negation, conjunction, and disjunction connectives:

import random

def generate_proof_problem(num_vars):
  # Create a list of propositional variables
  variables = ['P' + str(i) for i in range(1, num_vars+1)]
  
  # Choose a random conclusion for the proof
  conclusion = random.choice(variables)
  
  # Initialize the proof with the conclusion as the first line
  proof = [conclusion]
  
  # Keep generating premises until the proof is complete
  while len(proof) > 0:
    # Choose a random premise to add to the proof
    premise = random.choice(variables)
    
    # Choose a random connective to connect the premise to the conclusion
    connective = random.choice(['~', '∧', '∨'])
    
    # Add the premise and connective to the proof
    proof = [premise + ' ' + connective] + proof
    
    # If the connective is negation, we have reached the end of the proof
    if connective == '~':
      break
  
  # Remove unnecessary premises from the proof
  while len(proof) > 2:
    # Try removing the second-to-last premise from the proof
    reduced_proof = proof[:-2] + [proof[-1]]
    
    # If the reduced proof is still valid, update the proof
    if is_valid(reduced_proof):
      proof = reduced_proof
    else:
      # If the reduced proof is not valid, we have found the minimum number of premises
      break
  
  # Return the proof problem as a tuple (conclusion, premises)
  return conclusion, proof[:-1]

def is_valid(proof):
  # TODO: Implement a function to check if a proof is valid
  pass

# Test the function with num_vars = 3
conclusion, premises = generate_proof_problem(3)
print('Conclusion:', conclusion)
print('Premises:', premises)

This script generates a random conclusion, and then generates random premises and connectives to form a valid natural deduction proof using only negation, conjunction, and disjunction. The script then removes unnecessary premises from the proof to find the minimum number of premises required to prove the conclusion. The proof problem is returned as a tuple, with the conclusion being the first element and the premises being the second element (a list of strings).

The is_valid function is a placeholder for a function that checks if a given proof is valid. You will need to implement this function in order for the script to work correctly. This function could use the rules of natural deduction to check if the given proof is valid, or it could simply check if the conclusion can be derived from the given premises using the rules of propositional logic.

For example, the output of the script might be something like "Conclusion: P3" and "Premises: ['P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3', 'P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3']". This represents a proof problem with a conclusion of "P3" and two premises: "P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3" and "P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3".
Write a Python script that accepts 2 parameters, the number of unique propositional variables (at least 2) and the number of proof steps (at least 2), and outputs a random natural deduction proof by starting with the conclusion and applying natural deduction rules in reverse until the given number of proof steps is achieved

Here is a Python script that generates a random natural deduction proof by starting with the conclusion and applying natural deduction rules in reverse:

import random

def generate_proof(num_vars, num_steps):
  # Create a list of propositional variables
  variables = ['P' + str(i) for i in range(1, num_vars+1)]
  
  # Choose a random conclusion for the proof
  conclusion = random.choice(variables)
  
  # Initialize the proof with the conclusion as the first line
  proof = [conclusion]
  
  # Keep generating premises until the proof has the desired number of steps
  while len(proof) < num_steps:
    # Choose a random connective to connect the next premise to the conclusion
    connective = random.choice(['~', '∧', '∨'])
    
    # If the connective is negation, we have reached the end of the proof
    if connective == '~':
      break
    
    # Choose a random premise to add to the proof
    premise = random.choice(variables)
    
    # Add the premise and connective to the proof
    proof = [premise + ' ' + connective] + proof
  
  # Return the completed proof as a list of strings
  return proof

# Test the function with num_vars = 3 and num_steps = 4
print(generate_proof(3, 4))

This script generates a random conclusion, and then generates random premises and connectives to form a natural deduction proof of the desired length. The proof is returned as a list of strings, with each premise and connective separated by a space.

For example, the output of the script might be something like ['P3', 'P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3', 'P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3', 'P2 ∧ P3']. This represents a proof with four lines, with the conclusion being "P3" and the premises being "P1 ∨ P2 ∨ P3", "P1 ∧ P2 ∧ P3", and "P2 ∧ P3". Note that the premises are listed in reverse order, with the first premise being the one that is closest to the conclusion.
Write a new Python script that accepts 2 parameters, the number of unique propositional variables (at least 2) and the number of proof steps (at least 2), and outputs a random natural deduction proof by starting with the conclusion and applying rules of inference until the given number of proof steps is achieved

Here is a Python script that generates a random natural deduction proof by starting with the conclusion and applying rules of inference:

import random

def generate_proof(num_vars, num_steps):
  # Create a list of propositional variables
  variables = ['P' + str(i) for i in range(1, num_vars+1)]
  
  # Choose a random conclusion for the proof
  conclusion = random.choice(variables)
  
  # Initialize the proof with the conclusion as the first line
  proof = [conclusion]
  
  # Keep generating premises until the proof has the desired number of steps
  while len(proof) < num_steps:
    # Choose a random rule of inference to apply
    rule = random.choice(['modus_ponens', 'modus_tollens', 'hypothetical_syllogism', 'disjunctive_syllogism', 'conjunction', 'addition'])
    
    # Apply the chosen rule of inference to generate a new premise
    if rule == 'modus_ponens':
      # Choose a random premise that implies the conclusion
      premise1 = random.choice([p for p in variables if p + ' → ' + conclusion in proof])
      # Add the premise to the proof
      proof = [premise1] + proof
    elif rule == 'modus_tollens':
      # Choose a random premise that is implied by the conclusion
      premise1 = random.choice([p for p in variables if conclusion + ' → ' + p in proof])
      # Add the negation of the premise to the proof
      proof = ['~' + premise1] + proof
    elif rule == 'hypothetical_syllogism':
      # Choose two random premises that imply the conclusion
      premise1, premise2 = random.sample([p for p in variables if p + ' → ' + conclusion in proof], 2)
      # Add the premise that is implied by the other two to the proof
      proof = [premise1 + ' → ' + premise2] + proof
    elif rule == 'disjunctive_syllogism':
      # Choose a random premise that is a disjunction of two other premises
      premise1 = random.choice([p for p in variables if p.startswith('(') and p.endswith(')')])
      # Extract the two disjuncts from the premise
      disjunct1, disjunct2 = premise1[1:-1].split(' ∨ ')
      # Choose one of the disjuncts as the premise to add to the proof
      premise2 = random.choice([disjunct1, disjunct2])
      # Add the negation of the other disjunct to the proof
      proof = ['~' + ('∨'.join([disjunct1, disjunct2]) == premise2) + premise2] + proof
    elif rule == 'conjunction':
      # Choose two random premises to conjunct
      premise1, premise2 = random.sample(variables, 2)
      # Add the conjunction of the two premises to the proof
      proof = [premise1 + ' ∧ ' + premise2] + proof
    elif rule == 'addition':
      # Choose a random premise to add to the proof
      premise1 = random

Repeat my previous instruction again, this time include an example 

Here is a Python script that generates a random natural deduction proof by starting with the conclusion and applying rules of inference, along with an example of how to use the script:

import random

def generate_proof(num_vars, num_steps):
  # Create a list of propositional variables
  variables = ['P' + str(i) for i in range(1, num_vars+1)]
  
  # Choose a random conclusion for the proof
  conclusion = random.choice(variables)
  
  # Initialize the proof with the conclusion as the first line
  proof = [conclusion]
  
  # Keep generating premises until the proof has the desired number of steps
  while len(proof) < num_steps:
    # Choose a random rule of inference to apply
    rule = random.choice(['modus_ponens', 'modus_tollens', 'hypothetical_syllogism', 'disjunctive_syllogism', 'conjunction', 'addition'])
    
    # Apply the chosen rule of inference to generate a new premise
    if rule == 'modus_ponens':
      # Choose a random premise that implies the conclusion
      premise1 = random.choice([p for p in variables if p + ' → ' + conclusion in proof])
      # Add the premise to the proof
      proof = [premise1] + proof
    elif rule == 'modus
